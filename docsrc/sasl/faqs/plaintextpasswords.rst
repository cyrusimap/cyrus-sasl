Why does CyrusSasl store plaintext passwords in its databases?
--------------------------------------------------------------

To operate with the CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5 and SCRAM mechanisms, Cyrus SASL 
stores plaintext versions of the passwords in its secret database (an 
AuxpropPlugin). 

This is typically regarded as insecure practice, however the alternative 
is not much better. For CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5 and SCRAM to function, they must 
have a plaintext equivalent locally in order to confirm the hash that 
actually goes across a wire. This, if these equivalents were 
compromised, it is trivially easy for an attacker to have access to any 
account on the system. 

Note that for DIGEST-MD5 this isn't strictly true: the hash that DIGEST 
can use limits the attack to only the realm for which the password 
applies, but this is a questionable security gain for the increased 
management hassles (you can't share them between mechanisms) that the 
plaintext equivalents cause.
