New in 2.1.25
-------------

* Make sure that a failed authorization doesn't preclude
  further server-side SASL authentication attempts from working.
* Fixed a crash caused by aborted SASL authentication
  and initiation of another one using the same SASL context.
* (Windows) Fixed the random number generator to actually produce random
  output on each run.
* Be protective against calling sasl_server_step once authentication
  has failed (multiple SASL plugins)
* Fixed several bugs in the mech_avail callback handling
  in the server side code.
* Added support for channel bindings
* Added support for ordering SASL mechanisms by strength (on the client side),
  or using the "client_mech_list" option.

  context.
* Better server plugin API mismatch reporting
* Build:
  - Updated config to the latest GNU snapshot
  - Fixed SASL's libtool MacOS/X 64-bit file magic

    server-side HTTP Digest, including running over non-persistent
    connections (RFC 2617)

 - Minimize the number of auxprop lookups in the server side DIGEST-MD5
   plugin for the most common case when authentication and authorization
   identities are the same.
 - Updated digestmd5_server_mech_step2() to be more defensive against
   empty client input.
 - Fixed some memory leaks on failed plugin initialization.
   Prevent potential race condition when freeding plugin state.
   Set the freed reauthentication cache mutex to NULL, to make errors
   due to mutex access after free more obvious.
 - Test against broken UTF-8 based hashes if calculation using special
   ISO-8859-1 code fails.

   advertised realm and providing their own.

* GSSAPI plugin:

  - Fix to build GSSAPI with Heimdal

    Don't send empty challenge once server context establishment is done,
    as this is in violation of the RFC 2222 and its successor.
