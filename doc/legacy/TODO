Library
~~~~~~~
) Better/FASTER random numbers (init time is pretty miserable)
) Test suite [still] needs work
) better support for including missing routines
) check return settings (ssf, etc.) on auth failure

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
) so much to do here
) man pages (check spelling) 
) programmers/sysadmin guide updates and clarifications
) update INSTALL to have clearer step-by-step instructions

Mechs to write
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SRP
~~~
) Testing

OTP
~~~
) Checking edge cases
) Testing

Digest-MD5
~~~~~~~~~~
) Checking wacko cases or even not so wacko cases
) Testing

Kerberos_V4
~~~~~~~~~~~
) client-side should set realm
) is prompt_need callback set default value

GSSAPI
~~~~~~
) Allow specification of alternate keytab file

Plain
~~~~~

Cram-MD5
~~~~~~~~
) needs snprintf support

Database stuff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
) transactions?
) version the database?
) atomic updates of passwords (we can crash and leave the user with 
  different passwords for different mechanisms) [through failure to
  make setpass calls]
) locks (to help fortify protection against OTP race attack)?

ABI
~~~
) Consider IRIX ABI issues for plugins
	- /usr/lib32/sasl?
	- /usr/lib/sasl/{ABI}?
) Standardize the plugin ABI
