# This script changes a SASLDB2 realm to another one.

# Written by Sander Steffann <sander@steffann.nl>
# No rights reserved: do with this script as you please.
#
# Usage: change-sasldb2-realm.py <orig-realm> <new-realm>
# where <orig-realm> and <new-realm> are case-sensitive.
#
# !WARNING!  This script opens /etc/sasldb2 directly, without going through
#            the official API. If the file format changes this script breaks.
#
# The following file-format for sasldb2 is assumed: a BSD-DB hash-file with a
# key in the format "<data> \x00 <realm> \x00 <data>". The <data> parts are
# copied without modification. The values corresponding to the keys are copied
# without modification too.
#
# To be safe, this script opens /etc/sasldb2 read-only and writes the result
# to a new file: /etc/sasldb2.new. If this file exists this script will
# overwrite it. Don't overwrite your /etc/sasldb2 file until you are sure the
# results in /etc/sasldb2.new are what you want.
#
# This script uses the bsddb module provided with python. It is assumed that
# the DB library used by python is the same as the one used by SASL2. If this
# is not the case the script will abort with an error when opening sasldb2.
