Authentication Mechanisms
=========================

Mechanisms
==========

ANONYMOUS
---------

This mechanism does not require the client to authenticate or provide any information.

Defined in :rfc:`2245`

EXTERNAL
--------

EXTERNAL is a SASL Mechanism that allows a client to request the server to use credentials established by means external to the mechanism to authenticate the client.

SASL EXTERNAL means may be, for instance, IP Security (:rfc:`4301`) or TLS services.
In absence of a prior agreement between the client and the server, the client cannot make any assumption as to what SASL EXTERNAL means the server has used to obtain the client's credentials, nor make an assumption as to the form of credentials.
For example, the client cannot assume that the server will use the credentials the client has established via TLS.

.. note::
   The server will not offer EXTERNAL unless other credentials are already available in the session, such as a client certificate used in establishing a TLS connection.

GS2
-----

Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API).
The GS2 mechanism family offers a number of improvements over the previous :ref:`GSSAPI` mechanism.

Defined in :rfc:`5801`

.. _MECH-GSSAPI:

GSSAPI

GSS-SPNEGO
----------

This is a Microsoft specific customization of GSSAPI.

Described in the `Microsoft documentation <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-adts/e1cbe214-d73b-4c58-aad2-bee399ccdfb8>`_ and :rfc:`4178`

OTP
---

OTP is the One-Time Password system described in :rfc:`2289`.
This mechanism is secure against replay attacks and also avoids storing password or password equivalents on the server.
Only a digest of a seed and a passphrase is ever transmitted across the network.

  * OTP-MD4
  * OTP-MD5
  * OTP-SHA1

PASSDSS
-------

DSS Secured Password Authentication Mechanism (PASSDSS)

Documented in a `RFC Draft: draft-newman-sasl-passdss <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-newman-sasl-passdss>`_

  * PASSDSS-3DES-1

.. _MECH-PLAIN:

PLAIN
-----

Defined in :rfc:`4616`

This is the simplest mechanism.
The users authentication details are transmitted in plain text.
This mechanism should not be provided unless an encrypted link is in use - typically after TLS has been negotiated.

SCRAM
-----

Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) is a family of modern, password-based challengeâ€“response authentication mechanisms providing authentication of a user to a server.

Defined in :rfc:`5802`

  * SCRAM-SHA-1(-PLUS)
  * SCRAM-SHA-224(-PLUS)
  * SCRAM-SHA-256(-PLUS) (:rfc:`7677`)
  * SCRAM-SHA-384(-PLUS)
  * SCRAM-SHA-512(-PLUS)

SRP
---

The Secure Remote Password (SRP) is a password-based, zero-knowledge,
authentication and key-exchange protocol.
It has good performance, is not plaintext-equivalent and maintains perfect forward secrecy.
It provides authentication (optionally mutual authentication) and the negotiation of a shared context key.

Documented in a `RFC Draft: draft-burdis-cat-srp-sasl <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-burdis-cat-srp-sasl-08>`_

  * mda=sha1,rmd160,md5
  * confidentiality=des-ofb,des-ede-ofb,aes-128-ofb,bf-ofb,cast5-ofb,idea-ofb

Understanding this table:

Security Properties:

* **MAX SSF** - The maximum Security Strength Factor supported by the mechanism (roughly the number of bits of encryption provided, but may have other meanings, for example an SSF of 1 indicates integrity protection only, no encryption).
* **NOPLAIN** - Mechanism is not susceptible to simple passive (eavesdropping) attack.
* **NOACTIVE** - Protection from active (non-dictionary) attacks during authentication exchange. (Implies MUTUAL).
* **NODICT** - Not susceptible to passive dictionary attack.
* **NOFORWARD** - Breaking one session won't help break the next.
* **NOANON** - Don't permit anonymous logins.
* **CRED** - Mechanism can pass client credentials.
* **MUTUAL** - Supports mutual authentication (authenticates the server to the client)

Features:

* **CLTFIRST** - The client should send first in this mechanism.
* **SRVFIRST** - The server must send first in this mechanism.
* **SRVLAST** - This mechanism supports server-send-last configurations.
* **PROXY** - This mechanism supports proxy authentication.
* **BIND** - This mechanism supports channel binding.
* **HTTP** - This mechanism has a profile for HTTP.
